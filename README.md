3. Each individual must make their own submission by the deadline.
(a)   Submit your overall report including text, calculations   or drawing together via   Turnitin.
Make sure all your drawings are following the guidelines   for   “mechanical   drawing”   as   provided in the additional resources in LMS.Generate your 2D drawing using an appropriate software (e.g.   MS   Visio   or   AutoCAD)      rather than do it in manual, and generate 3D   drawing using AutoCAD   3D,   SketchUp   or   similar for 3D objects required in the   assignment.
Original files of   the 3D drawing must be uploaded in   a   separate   file.
(b) Submit your calculation toll in a single   sheet   Excel   spreadsheet   in   the   format   of   Excel Worksheet   .xlsx or   .xls to a secondary Turnitin portal and name your   Excel   spread   sheet   in your own name and student number,   e.g.
John   Smith_   123456_Assignment   1
For   Excel   sheet,you   can   refer   to   the   guidelines   given   in   the   lecture   note   on   “Calculation Tools” but DO NOT COPY the note.
The Excel sheet must be clear, logical, and working!
4. Bonus marks
Bonus marks of 1.5 are applicable to   each   assignment.
Submissions that demonstrate original critical thinking and exceptional quality   of   design   will be considered for bonus marks.
You are allowed to discuss your design with your fellow   students but:
You cannot use the same spread   sheet   as   another   student.

6. This is an   individual   assignment
The Design Problem
Aggressive   measures   need   to   betaken   to   address   the   greenhouse   gas   emissions   in   hard-to-abate industries, such as marine shipping and   aviation.   Air-to-fuel   has been   identified   as   a potential   pathway to produce carbon-neutral or carbon-negative chemical fuels from   air   components   and renewable energy.
Here, you are leading the design of   an air-to-fuel plant with   a   daily production rate   of   200 ton methanol (based on pure MeOH). A direct air capture   (DAC) unit   (denoted   as   D1   for   flowsheet)   based on amine scrubbing has been selected to produce high purity CO2    from air.   Assuming   50% capture efficiency, and 500 ppm CO2    in the atmosphere, the gases   CO2   produced by the   stripper   is   pressurized by a compressor (C1) to 3 MPa and   stored   in buffer tanks   (T1)   at   ambient   temperature   for the next step process. 
A water splitting unit operating at ambient pressure has been selected to produce high purity   hydrogen gas. The Faradaic efficiency towards H2    and current efficiency of   the   electrolyser   (E1)   is 100%, and 65% (i.e. 35% energy loss by   joule heat),   respectively.   The   electrolyser temperature must   be   kept   in   the   working   range   of   80 - 95 °C   which   is   achieved   by   removing   around   85%   of   the    joule heat by active cooling. Hot electrolyte (30% KOH   aqueous   solution)   at   95   °C bleeds   from   one   end of   the electrolyser and feeds to a heat   exchanger   (HE1);   after cooling   to   80   °C by   ambient running water, the electrolyte is mixed with   80 °C makeup water re-enters   the electrolyser   from   the   other end. The product H2    is pressurized by a compressor (C2) to 3 MPa   and   stored   in tanks   (T2) temporarily for subsequent processes.
The aforementioned H2    and CO2    gas at 3MPa aremixed at 3:1 ratio   (v/v)   and   stored   in   tanks   (T3). The mixed gas is then directed to a multi-cycle   catalyser   operating   at   250   °C   at   30 MPa   to produce methanol, via the following reaction:
3H2   + CO2   == CH3OH + H2O                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                (1)
For practical purpose,   100% conversion of   the raw gas and   100% MeOH selectivity   are
assumed. The products are fully condensed by a heat exchanger   (HE2)   to produce   liquid   MeOH   and   H2O. A distillation unit (D1) is employed to enrich the MeOH   to   99%   in   the   distillate   while   the residue should contain no more than   1% MeOH.
The final product MeOH   is stored in ambient tanks   (T4)   and   shipped by   trucks   for   sale.
The DAC and the catalyser are running continuously 24/7. Due to   the   intermittent nature   of solar   energy, the   water   electrolyseris   powered   by   compatible   solar   power   facility   during   the daytime and there is no power supply to the electrolyser during the nighttime.
Provide design specifications and equipment drawings for the   following pieces   of   equipment:
(1) tank T2
(2) heat exchanger HE1,   and
(3) distillation tower D1
The design specifications must follow the step-by-step calculations   as   shown   during   the
examples done in class following the outline in the   lecture notes.   For   each piece   of   equipment   you   must include:
1) a maximum one page executive   summary
2) an equipment   specification   sheet
3) the detailed design calculations and discussion   stating assumptions   used   in   the
calculations. (Follow   the Calculation Tools to make clear and legible calculations,   or   see   specific   requirements   of   the   individual   assignments)
4) an   engineering   drawing   of   the   equipment.
5) a 3D drawing of   the equipment. (or   see   specific requirements   of   the   individual assignments)
5) description of   the managerial, operational procedures and safety considerations   for   each   piece   of   equipment.    Explain   how   all   rules   and   regulations   of   the   statutory   authorities   are met.
6) references used for the design (must use Harvard   style).
Marks will be deducted if   the submission is not clear and   legible   or if   the   information   is   not presented   in   an   organised   and   logical   manner. Demonstration   of   original   thinking   will   be   required in order to gain full marks or even bonus.   Some template of equipment specification sheet on
Canvas may not represent perfect example, and exact copying of   that template will   compromise your marks.Propose a reasonable equipment layout.    The storage tanks   should be   located   at   least   100m      from other units of   operation. The flash drum and heat   exchanger   can   be placed between 40   to   50m   from the distillation tower. A process flow sheet and equipment   layout   (plan   view)   drawings   of   the   entire plant are also required.
Design data such as physical properties of   the liquids and   gasses   can be   found using   Hysys,   Aspen, or in Perry’s Chemical Engineers Handbook and CR Vol.   6   for   example.      The benzene-1-   pentanol VLE data are attached at the end   of   this   assignment   sheet.   Steam   at   a maximum pressure         of   6 atm and utility water (returned from an   evaporative   cooling tower)   at   15°C   are   available.
Marking rubric available on LMS.
